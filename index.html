      <p class="mb-5">On an offbeat morning, KEDI.DESIGN, after serving nearly a decade at the forefront of digital
        service design, delivering state-of-the-art UX design and machine learning services to top telecom operators,
        airlines, banks, and entertainment services across Turkey and the globe, awoke from a surreal dream. Suddenly,
        it was no longer just KEDI.DESIGN, it was a larger, much grander cat, and in a state of bemused disbelief, it
        roared: WTF!</p>
      <p class="mb-5">Its familiar digital fabric was now replaced with a vibrant, tactile fur that defied convention.
        Its binary gaze was now infused with a captivating blend of audacity and curiosity. The transformation had
        tipped the scales of normality.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">After a seemingly warp-speed hiatus of about two years, KEDI.WTF found itself nurturing two
        groundbreaking ventures: VINYLZ, an innovative company reshaping the boundaries between the physical and digital
        realms with its collectible designer toys, and M4RS, a video game studio fearlessly carving new narratives in
        the web3 gaming landscape.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">Every day, this unconventional feline entity embraced its Kafkaesque reality, living in an
        unpredictable symphony of absurdity and excitement. The metamorphosis it had undergone was more than just a
        physical change - it was a shift in its very existence. In this playground where digital and physical realms
        intertwined, KEDI.WTF was ready to leap, explore, and roar into new territories. The extraordinary saga of
        KEDI.WTF was only just beginning.</p>
